    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "## Preparing the Data\n",
    "Before data can be used as input for machine learning algorithms, it often must be cleaned, formatted, and restructured — this is typically known as **preprocessing**. Fortunately, for this dataset, there are no invalid or missing entries we must deal with, however, there are some qualities about certain features that must be adjusted. This preprocessing can help tremendously with the outcome and predictive power of nearly all learning algorithms."

    "### Transforming Skewed Continuous Features\n",
    "A dataset may sometimes contain at least one feature whose values tend to lie near a single number, but will also have a non-trivial number of vastly larger or smaller values than that single number.  Algorithms can be sensitive to such distributions of values and can underperform if the range is not properly normalized. With the census dataset two features fit this description: '`capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`. \n",

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "\n",
    "* SVMs are useful in a number of applications where the data has a higher level of features; for example, SVM is being used to predict diseases or biological problems based on people's genes.  While certain spots of the human genome are pretty well understood, we still don't understand a majority of it.  SVMs can help notice bigger patterns across the high number of dimensions that constitute our DNA.\n",
    "* SVMs perform well with large feature sets, even when the features outnumber the sample size.  It is extremely powerful, but still pretty memory efficient.\n",
    "* SVMs can be slow to train on large datasets.  SVMs can be thrown off by large amounts of noise or outliers.  And by default SVMs don't provide probability estimates, but if you need those estimates, you'll need to pair it with another algorithm to provide those estimates.\n",
    "* This model is a good candidate for this problem due to the high level of features (103), but it could be suceptible to noise in the data, and may take a while to train with my limited computing power and the large dataset.\n",

    "* Random Forest is useful in similar applications that a Decision Tree could work, but avoids overfitting the data.  One application is in banking by helping identify customers that would likely pay their loans vs ones that would default.  Random Forest can help identify patterns in a large, complicated dataset like banking customer data without worrying that it would overfit the data.\n",
    "* Random Forest can work very well on a dataset with a lot of features, while avoiding falling into overfitting like Decision Trees would tend to do on such a complex dataset.  Plus, it is flexible able to handle missing values and categorical values. It works well for either classification or regression.  Also, it can help identify important features in a dataset.\n",
    "* The model can require a very powerful machine when being run on a large dataset.  It might not be as effective as many other algorithms on datasets that only have a handful of features.  Generally, Random Forest works well on the types of problems that Decision Trees might work well on.\n",

    "\n",
    "* The Naive Bayes algorithm can be useful in many classification problems; one could be determining if a message is spam or not spam.  In this problem, it would calculate the probability of a message being spam given the presence and frequency of certain words.  However, it would not relate the presence of some words with the presence of others, thus the Naive part of the name.\n",
    "* Naive Bayes is very fast and lightweight, while also being applicable to both binary and multiclass classification.  It is pretty simple, but still very useful.  And it works even on smaller datasets.\n",
    "* Naive Bayes is truly naive in that there is no correlation between the features, even if in reality there is a 1:1 correlation.  Thus, it can miss out on things that most people would find extremely intuitave.\n",
    "* Bernoulli Naive Bayes is a good candidate due to the way we've formatted this dataset and my current understanding of the relationship between the various features (I don't yet have a strong hypothesis as to what features in this dataset might be reliable indicators of a higher income.).  The Bernoulli model specifically would work well because we've already one-hot encoded all the features, and the algorithm was tuned for binary/boolean variables and can work well with high dimensionality.  Plus, the Gaussian model assumes a Gaussian distribution, which I'm not currently sure we'd find in this dataset.  As a bonus, this model could be the easiest to train with such a large dataset.\n",

    "In order to most optimally find donors to our cause, we need to spend some more time improving the Random Forest Classifier model.  Looking at the attached graphs, there's one clear winner between the 3 initial models tested.  By default the accuracy and F-scores (beta is 0.5) are already pretty impressive, and I believe we can improve those metrics with a little bit of tuning.  With a training accuracy of 96.3% and testing accuracy of 84.3% (compare to 83.8% and 83.7% respectively for SVC, or 75.6% and 75.5% for Naive Bayes), we could almost act on this data as is, but we can and should do better!  The F-scores are where the differences are especially aparent:\n",
    "- Random Forest .937 train & .684 test\n",
    "- SVC .687 train & .674 test\n",
    "- Naive Bayes .546 train & .537 test\n",
    "\n",
    "On top of that the Random Forest model took almost no time to train, whereas the SVC machine required a noticable amount of time to churn through everything.  And while the discrepancy between the training and testing scores may seem that the Random Forest is trending towards overfitting, or just memorizing the data we should be able to overcome that by tuning the parameters and/or refining the features to weed out the noise.  The Random Forest method is perfectly suited to our dataset as it does well with a high level of parameters.  And we can use it to figure out which inputs most strongly correlate with which results, so we can prioritize our data gathering.  Finally, when we're runing this model in production, it'll be able to smoothly handle if some datafields are missing, which will be great since we won't be able to play 20 questions with every potential donor.\n",

    "Hi CharityML,\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, I'd be happy to explain how Random Forest works; I want you to feel completly comfortable investing the time and resources necessary to tune the model to perfection!  Random Forest is an Ensemble Method built on creating multiple, random Decision Trees and aggregating the results.  For example, if you wanted to find out what restaurant to eat at, you could call up all your friends and have each of them ask you the same exact series of 20+ (or possibly even hundreds of) questions like, \"Do you want Lunch food? Do you want Chinese food?  Do you want take out?  Do you want waiter service?  Are you okay with driving 10 miles?  etc.\"  That would be a Decision Tree model.  Or you could ask each of your friends to recommend a place and let them decide which questions to ask to narrow it down for you.  One might ask \"Do you want breakfast food?\" and \"Are you okay with walking 5 blocks?\"  Another might ask \"Do you want a burger?\" and \"Do you like drive-ins?\", and so on.  After you talk to enough of your friends, you'd notice some trends in which places tend to get recommended the most, even though the questions they ask would be random.  The advantage over the Decision Tree is that your friends might tend to get hung up on one of your questons and thus avoid telling you about a place that they really think you'd like, so it avoids potential bias in the questions throwing things off.\n",
    "\n",
    "So in a Random Forest algorithm, the questions (features) get split up into random groups of questions (a tree).  Then the data randomly gets fed through the different trees and the results get counted.  In the end, the highest number of votes indicate the prediction.  While any 1 vote may not display particularly meaningful results (due to the randomness of creating the trees), the aggregation of all the votes leads to a prediction that captures the real trends in the data without getting too thrown off by noise (or meaningless data).  This model truly sees the forest for the trees.\n",

    "\n",
    "An important task when performing supervised learning on a dataset like the census data we study here is determining which features provide the most predictive power. By focusing on the relationship between only a few crucial features and the target label we simplify our understanding of the phenomenon, which is most always a useful thing to do. In the case of this project, that means we wish to identify a small number of features that most strongly predict whether an individual makes at most or more than \\$50,000.\n",
    "\n",
    "Choose a scikit-learn classifier (e.g., adaboost, random forests) that has a `feature_importance_` attribute, which is a function that ranks the importance of features according to the chosen classifier.  In the next python cell fit this classifier to training set and use this attribute to determine the top 5 most important features for the census dataset."

    "- In `Question 6` I only got capital-gain correct; though I came close with education-num.\n",
    "- I was not close, but I was on the right track.  My fatal mistake was not realizing that these numbers were in relation to household income and not individual income (ie. a husband and wife would be counted together, not individually).  So for households with spouses or other arrangements of multiple people contributing to the same household, their incomes would often be multiplied by the number of adults in the household.  I was on the right track with education and capital gains, but only picked 1 category from each, since I figured the fields would provide roughly duplicate information.  These features are more relevant due to their patterns more consistently matching the income data and are not that surprising when you think about it."

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
